20,Our community continued to grow this quarter.,positive
21,We now reach more than 3.7 billion people monthly across our Family of Apps.,positive
22,"And while we continue to navigate some challenging dynamics of volatile macro economy, increasing competition, ad signal loss and growing costs from our long-term investments, I have to say that our product trends look better from what I see than some of the commentary I have seen suggests.",positive
23,There has been a bunch of speculation about engagement on our apps.,negative
24,And what we are seeing is more positive.,positive
25,"On Facebook specifically, the number of people using the service each day is the highest it’s ever been, nearly 2 billion and engagement trends are strong.",positive
26,Instagram has more than 2 billion monthly actives.,positive
27,"WhatsApp has more than 2 billion daily actives, also with the exciting trend that North America is now our fastest growing region.",positive
28,"Across the family, some apps maybe saturated in some countries or some demographics, but overall, our apps continue to grow from a large base.",positive
29,"We are also seeing engagement grow, especially strong growth in Reels.",positive
30,And I’ll share more details about that when I discuss our product priorities shortly.,neutral
31,"In terms of our business, total revenue grew slightly this quarter on a constant currency basis.",positive
32,"We are still behind where I think we should be, but we believe that we will return to healthier revenue growth trends next year.",positive
33,That said it’s not clear that the economy has stabilized yet.,negative
34,So we are planning our budget somewhat more conservatively.,negative
35,"In 2023, we are going to focus our investments on a small number of high priority growth areas.",positive
36,"So that means that some teams will grow meaningfully, but most other teams will stay flat or shrink over the next year.",neutral
37,"In aggregate, we expect to end 2023 as either roughly the same size or even a slightly smaller organization than we are today.",neutral
38,"Three of the primary areas we are going to focus on are our AI discovery engine that’s powering Reels and other recommendation experiences, our ads and business messaging platforms and our future vision for the metaverse.",neutral
39,The internal indications I have seen suggest we are doing leading work and are on the right track with these investments.,positive
40,So I think that we should keep investing heavily in these areas.,positive
41,"As I have shared before, our goal is to grow Family of Apps operating income such that even with our AI infrastructure and Reality Labs investments, we can still meaningfully grow our overall company operating income in the long-term.",neutral
42,Our current surge in CapEx is largely due to building out our AI infrastructure and we would expect CapEx to come down as a percent of revenue over the long-term.,positive
43,"We expect Reality Labs expenses will increase meaningfully again in 2023, with the biggest drivers of that being the launch of the next generation of our consumer Quest headset and hiring that has been done in 2022, but for which we are going to be paying the first full year of salaries next year.",negative
44,"More broadly, beyond 2023, we expect to pace Reality Labs investments to ensure that we can achieve our goal of growing overall company operating income.",positive
45,Our capital allocation philosophy over the long-term is to allocate a portion of the profits generated from the Family of Apps towards these future-focused areas while enabling a greater return of capital to shareholders.,neutral
46,Alright.,neutral
47,Now I’d like to share some updates on the progress that we are seeing in these product areas.,neutral
48,"Our AI discovery engine is playing an increasingly important role across our products, especially as advances enable us to recommend more interesting content from across our networks and feeds that used to be primarily driven just by the people and accounts you follow.",positive
49,"So this, of course, includes Reels, which continues to grow quickly across our apps, both in production and consumption.",positive
50,There are now more than 140 billion Reels plays across Facebook and Instagram each day.,positive
51,That’s a 50% increase from 6 months ago.,positive
52,Reels is incremental to time spent on our apps.,positive
53,The trends look good here and we believe that we are gaining time spent share on competitors like TikTok.,positive
54,"Over time, I expect a few things to set our products apart here.",neutral
55,"First is that our discovery engine work allows us to recommend all types of content beyond Reels as well, including photos, text, links, communities, short and long-form videos and more.",neutral
56,"Second is that we can mix this content along posts – alongside posts from your family and friends, which can’t be generated by AI alone.",neutral
57,And third is more social interactions move to messaging.,neutral
58,We are developing a flywheel between discovery and messaging that are going to make these apps stronger.,positive
59,"On Instagram alone, people already reshare Reels 1 billion times a day through DMs.",positive
60,"Moving to monetization, I’ve discussed in the past how the growth of short-form video creates near-term challenges since Reels doesn’t monetize at the rate of Feed or Stories yet.",negative
61,"That means that as Reels grows, we are displacing revenue from higher monetizing surfaces.",negative
62,"And I think this is clearly the right thing to do, so Reels can grow with the demand that we are seeing, but closing this gap is also a high priority.",positive
63,"Even with the progress we have made, we are still choosing to take a more than $500 million quarterly revenue headwind with this shift, but we expect to get to a more neutral place over the next 10 – sort of 12 to 18 months.",negative
64,I mentioned last quarter that Instagram Reels had crossed a $1 billion annual revenue run-rate.,positive
65,We continue scaling monetization across both Instagram and Facebook and the combined run-rate across these apps is now $3 billion.,positive
66,"Beyond Reels, messaging is another major monetization opportunity.",neutral
67,Billions of people and millions of businesses use WhatsApp and Messenger everyday and we are confident that we can connect them in ways that create valuable experiences.,positive
68,"We started with click-to-messaging ads which lets businesses run ads on Facebook and Instagram that start a thread on Messenger, WhatsApp or Instagram Direct, so they can communicate with customers directly.",neutral
69,And this is one of our fastest growing ads products with a $9 billion annual run-rate.,positive
70,"And this revenue is mostly on click to Messenger today since we started there first, but click to WhatsApp just passed a $1.5 billion run rate and growing more than 80% year-over-year.",positive
71,Paid messaging is another opportunity that we are starting to tap into.,positive
72,"And it continues to grow quickly, but from a smaller base.",positive
73,"We are putting the foundation in place now to scale this with key partnerships like Salesforce, which lets all businesses on their platform use WhatsApp as the main messaging service to answer customer questions and updates and sell directly in chat.",positive
74,"And we also launched JioMart on WhatsApp in India, and it’s our first end-to-end shopping experience that shows the potential for chat-based commerce through messaging.",positive
75,"So between click-to-messaging and paid messaging, I am confident that this is going to be a big opportunity.",positive
76,The last area that I want to discuss today is the metaverse.,neutral
77,"We just had our Connect conference and announced Quest Pro, which we just started shipping.",positive
78,It’s our new high-end VR headset that delivers high-resolution mixed reality so you can blend virtual objects into the physical environment around you.,positive
79,"It’s pretty amazing when you see it, and it’s going to enable all kinds of new experiences and socializing, gaming, fitness and work.",positive
80,And I am really looking forward to seeing what people build with this new capability.,positive
81,Work in the metaverse is a big theme for Quest Pro.,neutral
82,"There are 200 million people who get new PCs every year, mostly for work.",neutral
83,And our goal for the Quest Pro line over the next several years is to enable more and more of these people to get their work done in virtual and mixed reality eventually even better than they could on PCs.,neutral
84,"And to deliver a great work and productivity experience, I am excited about the partnerships that we announced with Microsoft, bringing their suite of productivity and enterprise management services to Quest; Adobe and Autodesk bringing their creative tools; Zoom bringing their communication platform; Accenture building solutions for enterprises and more.",positive
85,"There is still a long road ahead to build the next computing platform, but we are clearly doing leading work here.",positive
86,This is a massive undertaking.,positive
87,"And it’s often going to take a few versions of each product before they become mainstream, but I think that our work here is going to be of historic importance and create the foundation for an entirely new way that we will interact with each other and blend technology into our lives as well as the foundation for the long-term of our business.",positive
88,"So between the AI discovery engine, our ads and business messaging platforms and our future vision for the metaverse, those are three of the areas that we are focused on.",neutral
89,"I believe that the tougher prioritization, discipline and efficiency that we are driving across the organization will help us navigate the current environment and emerge an even stronger company.",positive
90,"As always, I am grateful to everyone at Meta for your hard work and to all of you for being on this journey with us.",neutral
91,"And with that, I am going to turn it over to Dave.",neutral
92,"Dave Wehner Thanks, Mark and good afternoon, everyone.",neutral

98,This includes a $413 million impairment of certain operating leases as part of our ongoing work to align our office facilities footprint with our anticipated operating needs.,negative
99,"In terms of the specific line items, cost of revenue decreased 1% as a reduction in Reality Labs hardware costs was offset by growth in infrastructure and content-related expenses.",positive
100,R&D increased 45% mainly driven by hiring within Family of Apps and Reality Labs segments as well as Reality Labs technology development costs.,negative
101,"Lastly, marketing and sales and G&A increased 6% and 15% respectively, mainly driven by headcount-related costs.",negative
102,"Our pace of hiring slowed in the third quarter, consistent with our previously stated plans.",negative
103,"We added 3,700 net new hires in Q3, down from our Q2 net additions of 5,700 despite Q3 typically being a seasonally stronger hiring period.",negative
104,"We expect hiring to slow dramatically going forward and to hold headcount roughly flat next year relative to current levels, which I will cover in my outlook section.",negative

116,"Facebook daily active users were 1.98 billion, up 3% or 54 million compared to last year.",positive
117,DAUs represented approximately 67% of the 2.96 billion monthly active users in September.,neutral
118,MAUs grew 48 million or 2% compared to last year.,positive
119,"Q3 total Family of Apps revenue was $27.4 billion, down 4%.",negative
120,"Q3 Family of Apps ad revenue was $27.2 billion, down 4%, but up 3% on a constant currency basis.",negative
121,"Consistent with our expectations, the headwind to year-over-year growth from Apple’s ATT changes diminished in Q3 as we lapped the first full quarter post the launch of iOS 14.5.",positive
122,"However, this was offset by weak advertising demand, which we believe continues to be impacted by the uncertain and volatile macroeconomic landscape.",negative
123,"As a result, our Q3 constant currency growth rate was in line with our Q2 rate.",neutral
124,The healthcare and travel verticals were the largest positive contributors to growth in Q3.,positive

130,"In Q3, the total number of ad impressions served across our services increased 17% and the average price per ad decreased 18%.",positive
131,Impression growth was driven by Asia-Pacific and rest of world.,positive
132,"The year-over-year decline in pricing was primarily driven by strong impression growth, especially from lower monetizing surfaces and regions, foreign currency depreciation and lower advertiser demand.",positive
133,"Family of Apps other revenue was $192 million, up 9%, driven by strong business messaging growth from our WhatsApp business platform, partially offset by a decline in other line items.",positive

135,"In Q3, Family of Apps expenses were $18.1 billion, representing 82% of our overall expenses.",neutral

144,We are making significant changes across the board to operate more efficiently.,positive
145,"We are holding some teams flat in terms of headcount, shrinking others and investing headcount growth only in our highest priorities.",positive
146,"As a result, we expect headcount at the end of 2023 will be approximately in line with third quarter 2022 levels.",neutral
147,We have increased scrutiny on all areas of operating expenses.,positive
148,"However, these moves follow a substantial investment cycle, so they will take time to play out in terms of our overall expense trajectory.",negative
149,"Some steps, like the ongoing rationalization of our office footprint, will lead to incremental costs in the near-term.",negative
150,This should set us up well for future years when we expect to return to higher rates of revenue growth.,positive

159,We do anticipate that Reality Labs operating losses in 2023 will grow significantly year-over-year.,negative

168,"We are carefully evaluating the return we achieved from these investments, which will inform the scale of our AI investment beyond 2023.",neutral

170,"In recent years, we have stepped up our investment in bringing more data center capacity online.",neutral
171,And that work is ongoing in 2023.,neutral
172,"We believe the additional data center capacity will provide us greater flexibility with the types of servers we purchase and allow us to use them for longer, which we expect to generate greater cost efficiencies over time.",positive
173,"These investments, along with revenue headwinds, are contributing to higher capital expenditures as a percentage of revenue in 2022 and 2023 than we expect over the long-term.",negative
174,Turning now to the specific CapEx outlook for ’22 and ’23.,neutral
175,"We expect 2022 capital expenditures, including principal payments on finance leases, to be in the range of $32 billion to $33 billion updated from our prior range of $30 billion to $34 billion.",neutral
